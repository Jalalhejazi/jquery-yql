# jQuery YQL
> Version 0.2

# What is this ?

A simple jQuery plugin that queries Yahoo's YQL, fetch the results
through JSONP, and calls success callback with the results.

# In a nutshell:
  <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery.yql.js"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
    $(function(){
      $.yql(
        "SELECT * FROM github.repo WHERE id='#{username}' AND repo='#{repository}'",
        {
          username: "gabrielfalcao",
          repository: "jquery-yql"
        },
        function (data) {
            if (data.results.repository["open-issues"].content > 0) {
                alert("Hey dude, you should check out your new issues!");
            }
        }
      );
     });
  </script>
